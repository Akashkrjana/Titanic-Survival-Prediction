# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Machine Learning project predicting passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using data preprocessing, visualization, and classification models.

This project is based on the classic Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle
.
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not using various machine learning models.

📌 Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib).

Feature engineering (new features like family size, title extraction).

Machine learning models for survival prediction (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.).

Model evaluation and accuracy comparison.
